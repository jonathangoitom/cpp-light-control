# üö¶ C++ Vehicle Light Control Simulation

This project simulates a simple vehicle light control system using a **state machine architecture** written in **modern C++17**. It's built to mimic typical embedded automotive logic ‚Äî but runs entirely in the terminal for easy testing and development.

---

## Features

- **Finite State Machine (FSM)** controlling light modes
- **State Pattern** design (OOP)
- Console-based simulation
- LED abstraction class for clean output control
- Realistic modes:
  - `NormalState` ‚Äì lights always on
  - `BlinkerState` ‚Äì single LED toggles
  - `WarningState` ‚Äì hazard lights (left & right blink)
  - `ComingHomeState` ‚Äì lights on for 10s, then off
- ‚å®Ô∏è Interactive via keyboard input

## Technologies Used

- C++17
- CMake (build system)
- std::chrono and std::thread for timing
- Terminal input/output
- PlantUML for diagram
